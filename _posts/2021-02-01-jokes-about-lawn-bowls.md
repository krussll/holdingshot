## A Selectors Prayer

Blessed are they who can play sport

Blessed are they who can still be taught

Blessed are they who accept with grace

To play in any selected place

## Nobody's Darling

Up and down, walking walking,

Often measuring, sometimes chalking;

Shifting mats - keeping score,

thirty ends, maybe more;

Aching back - tired of limb,

Cheers for others, none for him,

Night draws on, darker, darker,

No one cares for he's the marker!

## Selectors in Heaven

Three bowlers stood at the pearly gates,

Their faces were sad and old.

They humbly asked the man at the gate,

Admission to the fold.

"What have you done?", St. Peter said,

"To gain admission here".

"Selectors sir, we have been

For many a weary year".

The gates of Heaven flew open wide,

As St. Peter pressed the bell.

"Come in at once and take a harp,

You've had enough of hell!"

Lady bowlers come and go

Dress rules go on forever

How dare you try to make a change

No never, never, never.

The men think we are a joke

and look like mobs of sheep

With madam snapping at our heels

It's to the rules you'll keep.

The young are keen to play the game

But won't of course unless

We put some colour on our frame

And try to change our dress.

The men indeed have got more sense

Their rules are not so stuffy

They have more fun and play the game

You've guessed it; dressed in 'mufti'.

## Transplant issues

A lawn bowler was involved in a terrible car crash and was rushed to hospital.

Just before he was put under, the surgeon popped in to see him and says, "I have some good news and some bad news".

"The bad news is that I have to remove your right arm!"

"Oh God no!" cries the man "My bowling is over! Please Doc, what's the good news?"

Doc "The good news is, I have another one to replace it with, but it's a woman's arm. I'll need your permission before I go ahead with the transplant."

"Go for it doc" says the man. "As long as I can play bowls again."

The operation went well and a year later the man was out on the local bowls green when he bumped into the surgeon. "G'day mate, how's the new arm?" asks the surgeon.

"Just great," says the man. "I'm playing the best bowls of my life. My new arm has a much finer touch and my draw bowls have really improved."

"That's great," said the surgeon.

"Not only that," continued the bowler, "My handwriting has improved, I've learned how to sew my own clothes and I've even taken up painting landscapes in water colours."

"Unbelievable!" said the surgeon, "I'm so glad to hear the transplant was such a great success. Are you having any side effects?"

"Well, just one problem," said the bowler "Every time I get an erection, I also get a headache."

## The Bowlers' own language - how to translate

"Good weight!" = lousy line

"Good line" = lousy weight

"Good back bowl" = you were lucky you didn't put it in the ditch

"That's in their way" = that's in my way

"That could be useful up there" = that bowl is closer to you than it is to the jack

"Get it next time" = you sure didn't get it this time

"He's surprisingly good" = you're surprised he ever makes a shot

"I'd bowl with him any day" = he always buys the first round

A man was walking down the street when he was approached by a particularly

dirty and shabby-looking homeless man who asked him for a couple of dollars

for dinner.
